Scenario 1: Validate delay in execution when mode is 2
Details:
  TestName: test_delay_mode_two
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly introduces a delay of 2 seconds when the mode is set to 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement is needed as the function does not require any pre-existing objects or environment setup.
  Act: Invoke the delay function with mode set to 2.
  Assert: Check the time before and after the function execution. The difference should be approximately 2 seconds.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Ensuring that the function correctly introduces a delay when the mode is set to 2 is important, as this is a key aspect of the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Validate no delay in execution when mode is not 2
Details:
  TestName: test_no_delay_mode_not_two
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function does not introduce any delay when the mode is not set to 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement is needed as the function does not require any pre-existing objects or environment setup.
  Act: Invoke the delay function with mode set to a value other than 2.
  Assert: Check the time before and after the function execution. The difference should be negligible, indicating no delay.
Validation:
  Rationalize: It is crucial to verify that the function does not introduce unnecessary delays when the mode is not set to 2, as this is a primary requirement of the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Validate function behavior with non-integer input
Details:
  TestName: test_delay_with_non_integer_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the function behaves when the mode is not an integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement is needed as the function does not require any pre-existing objects or environment setup.
  Act: Invoke the delay function with mode set to a non-integer value.
  Assert: The function should not crash and should execute without any delay, as the mode is not equal to 2.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Testing the function's behavior with non-integer input is important to ensure its robustness and error tolerance. The function should not introduce any delay when the mode is not equal to 2, irrespective of the input type.
