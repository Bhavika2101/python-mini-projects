Scenario 1: Test when a winning move exists for the computer
Details:
  TestName: test_compAI_winning_move_exists
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the CompAI function correctly identifies a winning move when one exists and returns the position of that move.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board state where the computer has a winning move.
  Act: Invoke the CompAI function with the prepared board state, computer's name, and choice.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the position of the winning move.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the CompAI function correctly prioritizes a winning move when one exists. This is an essential aspect of its business logic.

Scenario 2: Test when a blocking move exists for the computer
Details:
  TestName: test_compAI_blocking_move_exists
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the CompAI function correctly identifies a blocking move when one exists and returns the position of that move.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board state where the opponent has a potential winning move next turn.
  Act: Invoke the CompAI function with the prepared board state, computer's name, and choice.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the position of the blocking move.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the CompAI function correctly prioritizes a blocking move when one exists. This is a critical aspect of its defensive strategy.

Scenario 3: Test when a corner move is the best move
Details:
  TestName: test_compAI_corner_move
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the CompAI function correctly identifies when a corner move is the best move and returns the position of that move.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board state where the corners are the best moves.
  Act: Invoke the CompAI function with the prepared board state, computer's name, and choice.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the position of a corner move.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the CompAI function correctly prioritizes corner moves when they are the best moves. This is a part of its strategic logic.

Scenario 4: Test when the center move is the best move
Details:
  TestName: test_compAI_center_move
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the CompAI function correctly identifies when the center move is the best move and returns the position of that move.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board state where the center is the best move.
  Act: Invoke the CompAI function with the prepared board state, computer's name, and choice.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the position of the center move.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the CompAI function correctly prioritizes the center move when it is the best move. This is a part of its strategic logic.

Scenario 5: Test when an edge move is the best move
Details:
  TestName: test_compAI_edge_move
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the CompAI function correctly identifies when an edge move is the best move and returns the position of that move.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board state where the edges are the best moves.
  Act: Invoke the CompAI function with the prepared board state, computer's name, and choice.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the position of an edge move.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the CompAI function correctly prioritizes edge moves when they are the best moves. This is a part of its strategic logic.
