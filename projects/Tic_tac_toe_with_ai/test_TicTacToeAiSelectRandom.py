Scenario 1: Test for correct random selection from the board
Details:
  TestName: test_selectRandom
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function selectRandom is correctly picking a random element from the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with known elements.
  Act: Invoke the selectRandom function with the initialized board.
  Assert: Check if the returned element is in the board.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the function is correctly picking a random element from the board. If the function returns an element not in the board, it means the function is not working as expected.

Scenario 2: Test for correct handling of an empty board
Details:
  TestName: test_selectRandom_empty_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function selectRandom is correctly handling the case where the board is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty board.
  Act: Invoke the selectRandom function with the empty board.
  Assert: Check if the function raises an error.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles the edge case where the board is empty. If the function does not raise an error in this case, it means the function is not correctly handling this edge case.

Scenario 3: Test for correct handling of a board with a single element
Details:
  TestName: test_selectRandom_single_element_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function selectRandom is correctly handling the case where the board has a single element.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with a single known element.
  Act: Invoke the selectRandom function with the single-element board.
  Assert: Check if the returned element is the same as the known element.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles the edge case where the board has a single element. If the function does not return the single element, it means the function is not correctly handling this edge case.
