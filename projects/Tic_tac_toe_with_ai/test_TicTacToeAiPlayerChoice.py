Scenario 1: Valid Position Input
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_position_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies a valid position input within the range of 1-9 and the position is not occupied on the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with some positions occupied and some vacant. Also, prepare a valid position input for the player.
  Act: Invoke the function player_choice with the prepared board, player name, and the player's choice.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the same as the input position, indicating that the function has correctly identified it as a valid input.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can correctly identify valid inputs according to the game rules, which is crucial for the game to proceed correctly.

Scenario 2: Invalid Position Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_position_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies an invalid position input, either outside the range of 1-9 or for an already occupied position on the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with some positions occupied. Also, prepare an invalid position input for the player.
  Act: Invoke the function player_choice with the prepared board, player name, and the player's choice.
  Assert: The function should raise an exception or return an error message indicating that the input is invalid.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies invalid inputs and prevents the game from proceeding with an invalid move.

Scenario 3: Empty Input
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies an empty input as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty input for the player.
  Act: Invoke the function player_choice with the prepared input.
  Assert: The function should raise an exception or return an error message indicating that the input is invalid.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies empty inputs as invalid, preventing the game from proceeding without a move.

Scenario 4: Input with Spaces
Details:
  TestName: test_input_with_spaces
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies an input with spaces as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an input with spaces for the player.
  Act: Invoke the function player_choice with the prepared input.
  Assert: The function should raise an exception or return an error message indicating that the input is invalid.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies inputs with spaces as invalid, preventing the game from proceeding with an invalid move.
