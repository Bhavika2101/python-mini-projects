Scenario 1: Space Check with Empty Position
Details:
  TestName: test_space_check_empty
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the space_check function correctly identifies an empty position on the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with a position that is empty.
  Act: Invoke the space_check function, passing in the board and the position of the empty space.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  It's important to ensure that the function correctly identifies empty spaces, as this is a fundamental part of the game logic. If the function fails to identify empty spaces correctly, it could result in invalid moves being allowed.

Scenario 2: Space Check with Occupied Position
Details:
  TestName: test_space_check_occupied
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the space_check function correctly identifies an occupied position on the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with a position that is occupied.
  Act: Invoke the space_check function, passing in the board and the position of the occupied space.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  The function must accurately identify occupied spaces to prevent overwriting existing moves, which would disrupt game play and potentially lead to incorrect results.

Scenario 3: Space Check with Position Out of Range
Details:
  TestName: test_space_check_out_of_range
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the space_check function when a position outside the range of the board is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with a known configuration.
  Act: Invoke the space_check function, passing in the board and a position that is outside the range of the board.
  Assert: Expect the function to throw an exception.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function handles out-of-range positions correctly is important for maintaining the integrity of the game. If such positions are not handled correctly, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Scenario 4: Space Check with Position at the Edge of the Board
Details:
  TestName: test_space_check_edge
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the space_check function correctly identifies whether the positions at the edge of the board are empty or occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with known configurations at the edge positions.
  Act: Invoke the space_check function, passing in the board and a position at the edge of the board.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct value based on whether the edge position is empty or occupied.
Validation:
  Testing edge positions is important to ensure the function works correctly across the entire board. If the function fails to correctly identify the status of edge positions, it could lead to incorrect game play at these critical points.
