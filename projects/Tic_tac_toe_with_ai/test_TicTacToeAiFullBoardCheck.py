ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=full_board_check_d5fc721cf3

Scenario 1: Validate the case where the board is not full
Details:
  TestName: test_full_board_check_not_full
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies a board that is not yet full. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with at least one space empty.
  Act: Call the full_board_check function with the prepared board.
  Assert: The expected outcome is False, indicating the board is not full.
Validation:
  It is important to ensure the function can correctly identify a non-full board to prevent premature termination of the game.

Scenario 2: Validate the case where the board is full
Details:
  TestName: test_full_board_check_full
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies a full board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with no spaces empty.
  Act: Call the full_board_check function with the prepared board.
  Assert: The expected outcome is True, indicating the board is full.
Validation:
  It is essential to ensure that the function can correctly identify a full board to end the game at the appropriate time and declare a draw if necessary.

Scenario 3: Validate the case where the board is partially full
Details:
  TestName: test_full_board_check_partially_full
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies a board that is partially full.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with some spaces empty and some filled.
  Act: Call the full_board_check function with the prepared board.
  Assert: The expected outcome is False, indicating the board is not full.
Validation:
  It is crucial to ensure the function can correctly identify a partially full board to continue the game until the board is fully occupied.

Scenario 4: Validate the case where the board is initially empty
Details:
  TestName: test_full_board_check_empty
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies an initially empty board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty board.
  Act: Call the full_board_check function with the prepared board.
  Assert: The expected outcome is False, indicating the board is not full.
Validation:
  It's important to ensure the function accurately identifies an empty board, as this is the initial state of the game.
