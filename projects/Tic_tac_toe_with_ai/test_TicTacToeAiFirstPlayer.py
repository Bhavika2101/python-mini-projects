Scenario 1: Test for Randomness of Function
Details:
  TestName: test_randomness
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function first_player is truly random by checking that the function does not return the same value every time it is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required for this test.
  Act: Call the function multiple times and store the results.
  Assert: Check that the results contain both 0 and 1.
Validation:
  This test is important because the function's specification and business requirement is to randomly decide who will go first. Thus, if it always returns the same value, it is not fulfilling its purpose.

Scenario 2: Test for Valid Output
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_output
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function first_player always returns either 0 or 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required for this test.
  Act: Call the function multiple times and store the results.
  Assert: Check that each result is either 0 or 1.
Validation:
  This test is important because the function's specification and business requirement is to return either 0 or 1. Any other output would be a violation of this requirement.

Scenario 3: Test for Function's Performance
Details:
  TestName: test_performance
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function first_player can execute quickly enough to not cause performance issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the time module to track how long the function takes to execute.
  Act: Call the function multiple times and calculate the average execution time.
  Assert: Check that the average execution time is below a certain threshold.
Validation:
  This test is important because if the function takes too long to execute, it could cause performance issues for the application in which it is used.
