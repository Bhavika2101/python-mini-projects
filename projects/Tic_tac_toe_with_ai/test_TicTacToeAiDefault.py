Scenario 1: Validate the initiation of the game
Details:
  TestName: test_game_initiation
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the game is initiated properly with a welcome message.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the default function.
  Assert: Check if the welcome message "Welcome! Let's play TIC TAC TOE!" is printed.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements. This test is important as it validates the first step of the game initiation. A proper welcome message is necessary for the user to understand that the game has started.

Scenario 2: Validate the printing of the welcome message
Details:
  TestName: test_welcome_message
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the welcome message is printed correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the default function.
  Assert: Check if the welcome message is printed correctly as "Welcome! Let's play TIC TAC TOE!".
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements. This test is important as it verifies the accuracy of the welcome message. Any discrepancies in the message might confuse the user.

Scenario 3: Validate the function execution time
Details:
  TestName: test_execution_time
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function executes within an acceptable time frame.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the default function and record the execution time.
  Assert: Check if the execution time is within the acceptable range.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements. This test is important as it ensures the function does not take too long to execute, which could lead to a poor user experience.
