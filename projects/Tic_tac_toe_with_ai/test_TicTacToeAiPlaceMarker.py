Scenario 1: Test if the choice marker replaces the specific position on the board
Details:
  TestName: test_place_marker_replacement
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function is able to successfully replace the specific position on the board with the choice marker.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board and available positions list with some values. Also, define a choice and position for the marker.
  Act: Invoke the function place_marker with the initialized board, available positions, choice and position.
  Assert: Check if the specified position on the board is replaced with the choice marker.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the basic functionality of the place_marker function. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications of replacing a position on the board with the choice marker.

Scenario 2: Test if the specific position on the available positions list is updated
Details:
  TestName: test_avail_position_update
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function is able to update the specific position on the available positions list after placing the marker.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board and available positions list with some values. Also, define a choice and position for the marker.
  Act: Invoke the function place_marker with the initialized board, available positions, choice and position.
  Assert: Check if the specified position on the available positions list is updated to empty string.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the place_marker function updates the available positions list correctly after placing a marker. This is essential for the game logic to know which positions on the board are still available.

Scenario 3: Test the function with the last available position on the board
Details:
  TestName: test_place_marker_last_position
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function is able to handle the edge case where the marker is placed on the last available position on the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board and available positions list with only one position available. Also, define a choice and position for the marker.
  Act: Invoke the function place_marker with the initialized board, available positions, choice and position.
  Assert: Check if the specified position on the board is replaced with the choice marker and the position on the available positions list is updated.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the place_marker function can handle edge cases correctly. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications and ensures that the game can be played till the last available position on the board.
