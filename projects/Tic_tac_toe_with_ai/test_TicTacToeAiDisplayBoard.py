Scenario 1: Test the display of the board with all available spots
Details:
  TestName: test_display_board_all_spots_available
  Description: This test is intended to verify the display when all the spots on the board are available.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the board and avail lists with empty strings.
  Act: Invoke the display_board function with the initialized board and avail lists.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected output where all the spots are empty.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the board is displayed correctly when no moves have been made yet. The expected result is that all spots on the board are empty, which aligns with the function's specifications and the game's rules.

Scenario 2: Test the display of the board with some spots taken
Details:
  TestName: test_display_board_some_spots_taken
  Description: This test is intended to verify the display when some spots on the board are taken.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the board list with some spots taken and the avail list accordingly.
  Act: Invoke the display_board function with the initialized board and avail lists.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected output where some spots are taken and others are available.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the board is displayed correctly during the game. The expected result is that the spots that are taken are displayed correctly and the available spots are also displayed correctly. This aligns with the function's specifications and the game's rules.

Scenario 3: Test the display of the board when the board is full
Details:
  TestName: test_display_board_all_spots_taken
  Description: This test is intended to verify the display when all the spots on the board are taken.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the board list with all spots taken and the avail list accordingly.
  Act: Invoke the display_board function with the initialized board and avail lists.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected output where all the spots are taken.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the board is displayed correctly when the game is over. The expected result is that all spots on the board are taken, which aligns with the function's specifications and the game's rules.
