================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Tkinter Library
Issue: Using Tkinter library can expose applications to attacks as it is not designed with security in mind.
Solution: Validate all inputs and outputs when using Tkinter library. Avoid using it if possible when dealing with sensitive information.

Vulnerability: GUI Injection Attack
Issue: If user input is directly passed to GUI components without any sanitization, it could lead to potential GUI injection attacks.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize user input before passing it to GUI components. Implement proper error handling and restrict error message details that are presented to the user.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate the empty string situation
Details:
  TestName: test_clear_empty_string
  Description: In this test, the method is invoked with an empty string. The intention is to verify that the clear operation on empty string does not affect the program, making sure that there is no unexpected behavior when the string is already empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: The test will create an empty string.
  Act: Invokes the delete method with beginning and end parameters. 
  Assert: The string must remain empty since no characters are removed.
Validation:
  It's necessary to ensure that the clear method can gracefully handle empty strings without causing any errors or issues. 

Scenario 2: Validate condition when an attempt is made to wipe out entire entry
Details:
  TestName: test_clear_whole_string
  Description: This test validates proper string deletion when called with parameters intending to delete the entire string. 
Execution:
  Arrange: We initialize a non-empty string.
  Act: Invoke the delete function in such a way that it deletes the entire string.
  Assert: The resulting string must be empty since all characters are removed.
Validation:
  This scenario tests whether the method can correctly clear an entire string or entry. 

Scenario 3: Clearing a String in Reverse Order
Details:
  TestName: test_clear_in_reverse
  Description: Here, we are attempting to clear a string in the reverse order by making the starting index greater than the end index. The purpose is to verify whether the method can handle such unusual cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a non-empty string.
  Act: Invoke the delete function with the start index higher than the end index.
  Assert: As the method execution should fail, the original string is expected to remain unchanged.
Validation:
  The function should be able to signal an error and not crash when parameters are provided in an unexpected order. Ensuring such conditions improves the reliability of the function.

Scenario 4: Validation of Non-existing indexes 
Details:
  TestName: test_clear_invalid_index
  Description: This test involves invoking the delete function with indexes that don't exist in the string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a non-empty string.
  Act: Invoke the delete function with indexes outside the length of string boundaries.
  Assert: Original string remains intact as changes made at invalid indexes should not result in any modification.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's robustness to invalid input parameters, ensuring that such parameters will not cause unexpected behavior or failures.
