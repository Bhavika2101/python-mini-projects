================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: General Python Security
Issue: The code does not show any specific security issues, but it's always important to follow best Python security practices.
Solution: Never use eval() with user inputs, do not expose sensitive information in error messages, always validate and sanitize user inputs.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with a non-empty string
Details:
  TestName: test_backspace_with_non_empty_string
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly removes the last character of a string when it is not empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a string with a known value.
  Act: Invoke the backspace function with the initialized string.
  Assert: Check if the last character of the string has been removed.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important to verify the basic functionality of the backspace function. It should behave as expected when the string is not empty.

Scenario 2: Test with an empty string
Details:
  TestName: test_backspace_with_empty_string
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the function behaves when it is given an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the backspace function with the empty string.
  Assert: Check if the string remains empty.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important to verify the edge case where the function is invoked with an empty string. The function should handle this case gracefully without throwing any exceptions.

Scenario 3: Test with a string of length 1
Details:
  TestName: test_backspace_with_single_char_string
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the function behaves when it is given a string with only one character.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a string with a single character.
  Act: Invoke the backspace function with the single character string.
  Assert: Check if the string becomes empty.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important to verify another edge case where the function is invoked with a single character string. The function should handle this case correctly by removing the only character in the string.

Scenario 4: Test with a long string
Details:
  TestName: test_backspace_with_long_string
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the function behaves when it is given a long string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a long string.
  Act: Invoke the backspace function with the long string.
  Assert: Check if the last character of the string has been removed.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is important to verify that the function can handle strings of any length. The function should behave as expected regardless of the string's length.
