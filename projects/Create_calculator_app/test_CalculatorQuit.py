================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Exit CWE-382
Issue: The 'quit' function directly calls 'root.quit()', which can lead to abrupt termination of the program, potentially leaving resources in an undefined state or not properly cleaning up.
Solution: Consider implementing a controlled shutdown process that assures resources are properly released and data is saved before exiting.

Vulnerability: Improper Import CWE-1004
Issue: The import statement 'from tkinter import *' can lead to unexpected behaviors if a module contains items that overwrite existing functions or variables, potentially leading to code execution issues or data leaks.
Solution: It is recommended to import only the specific functions and classes you need from a module, or import the entire module and use it with a prefix to avoid naming collisions.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test if the quit function successfully calls the root.quit() command
Details:
  TestName: test_quit_command_called
  Description: This test is intended to verify whether the quit function correctly triggers the root.quit() command.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the root.quit() command.
  Act: Call the quit function.
  Assert: Check if the root.quit() command has been called.
Validation:
  Rationalization: This test is important to ensure that the function is able to successfully call the root.quit() command. This is crucial for the application to be able to exit when required.

Scenario 2: Test if the quit function assigns the root.quit() command to the 'command' key in the exit dictionary
Details:
  TestName: test_quit_command_assignment
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the quit function assigns the root.quit() command to the 'command' key in the exit dictionary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty exit dictionary and mock the root.quit() command.
  Act: Call the quit function.
  Assert: Check if the 'command' key in the exit dictionary has been assigned the root.quit() command.
Validation:
  Rationalization: This test is crucial to ensure that the 'command' key in the exit dictionary is assigned the root.quit() command. This is required for the application to exit as expected when the quit function is called.

Scenario 3: Test if the quit function handles the scenario when the root.quit() command is not available
Details:
  TestName: test_quit_command_not_available
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the quit function handles the scenario when the root.quit() command is not available.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the root.quit() command to simulate the scenario where the command is not available.
  Act: Call the quit function.
  Assert: Check if the function handles the exception and does not crash the application.
Validation:
  Rationalization: This test is important to ensure that the application does not crash when the root.quit() command is not available. It should handle such scenarios gracefully.
