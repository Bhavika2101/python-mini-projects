================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Arbitrary Code Execution
Issue: The input taken from the user in the 'calc' function is directly evaluated using the 'eval' function. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if user provided input is not properly sanitized.
Solution: Avoid using 'eval' where possible. If it's necessary, make sure to sanitize and limit the input that it's receiving. A safer approach in this case might be using built-in parsing libraries or implementing a whitelist of allowed expressions

Vulnerability: Error Message Information Leak
Issue: When the 'ZeroDivisionError' is caught, a 'popupmsg' function is called, but it is not defined in the code. Depending on the implementation of this function, this could leak application internals to the user, which can be used for further attacks.
Solution: Ensure the error message passed to 'popupmsg' does not reveal sensitive application internals or system information. Implement a custom error handling that conceals sensitive information while informing the user about the error.

================================================================================
````
Scenario 1: Successful calculation
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_calculation
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the calculator can perform mathematical calculations because this is one of the main functionalities it is supposed to provide.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an Entry object with a mathematical expression like "2*2".
  Act: Invoke the calc method passing the Entry object.
  Assert: Check if the Entry object's get method returns "4".
Validation:
  It is crucial to ensure that the calculator can perform basic calculations. If this fails, the main functionality of the application is not met.

Scenario 2: Zero division error
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_division_error
  Description: This test verifies that the calculator handles ZeroDivisionError gracefully. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an Entry object with a mathematical expression like "1/0".
  Act: Invoke the calc method passing the Entry object.
  Assert: Check if the Entry object's get method returns an empty string.
Validation:
  This tests the error handling mechanism. A zero division error should be caught and managed appropriately, according to the business rule stated in the code.

Scenario 3: Empty input
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function handles empty inputs correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an Entry object with an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the calc method passing the Entry object.
  Assert: Check if the Entry object's get method returns a blank string.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that if the user does not input anything, the function does not throw any unexpected errors, and operates as per expectations.

Scenario 4: Testing with spaces
Details:
  TestName: test_input_with_spaces
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the calc function correctly handles input with space.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an Entry object with a mathematical expression like "     2*2     ".
  Act: Invoke the calc method passing the Entry object.
  Assert: Check if the Entry object's get method returns "4", ensuring that leading or trailing spaces in the input have no impact on the calculation.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's robustness to variations in user input. This corresponds to reality where users might input information in a variety of formats.
