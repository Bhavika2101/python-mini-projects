================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: If user input is directly inserted into an SQL query, this could lead to SQL injection attacks where an attacker can manipulate the query to execute arbitrary SQL code.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to avoid SQL injection. Do not construct SQL queries using string concatenation of unchecked user input.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: If user input is directly inserted into web pages without proper sanitization, this could lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page.
Solution: Use proper output encoding when inserting user data into HTML. Consider using frameworks that automatically provide this feature. Always validate and sanitize user input.
