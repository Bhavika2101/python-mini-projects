================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command
Issue: Any command execution based on untrusted user's input
Solution: Avoid command execution based on user's input, if necessary sanitize and validate input data beforehand.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: Running SQL queries with unsanitized user's input can result in SQL Injection attacks.
Solution: Adapt use of parameterized SQL queries or sanitizing and validating user's input data.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: Manipulating file operations using user's input can lead to file exposure or unwanted write operations.
Solution: Ensure proper permissions and avoid file operations based on user's input, if necessary sanitize and validate input data beforehand.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Check if the popup window is created on invoking popupmsg
Details:
  TestName: test_popupmsg_window_creation
  Description: The test should verify if a Tk popup window is created when the function popupmsg is triggered.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate Tk class for GUI creation
  Act: Invoke the function popupmsg
  Assert: Check if the popup window is created
Validation:
  This test validates that the function popupmsg is capable of successfully creating a popup window when invoked. It is critical to ensure the GUI is functional, as the calculator alerts employ this mechanism to show the user any warnings or error messages.

Scenario 2: Verify if the popup window is non-resizable
Details:
  TestName: test_popupmsg_non_resizable
  Description: This test verifies that the popup window created by popupmsg is non-resizable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Invoke popupmsg to create a popup window.
  Act: Attempt to resize the window.
  Assert: Check if the window size remains as specified (120x100).
Validation:
  This test ensures the design element of the function is maintained, which is that the popup windows created are not resizable. This design decision might be made to maintain uniformity across all alerts to the user.

Scenario 3: Test the title of the popup window
Details:
  TestName: test_popupmsg_window_title
  Description: This test verifies that the title of the popup window created by popupmsg is "Alert".
Execution:
  Arrange: Invoke popupmsg to create popup window.
  Act: Capture the title of the window.
  Assert: Check if the title matches the text "Alert".
Validation:
  This test confirms that the message title correctly communicates that it is an alert to the user. In an application, conveying the right titles for alerts, information or error popups is crucial for the user to understand the context of the message.

Scenario 4: Test the message on the popup window
Details:
  TestName: test_popupmsg_window_message
  Description: This test confirms that the message on the popup window is as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Invoke popupmsg to create popup window.
  Act: Capture the message displayed on the window.
  Assert: Check whether the message matches "Cannot divide by 0 ! \n Enter valid values".
Validation:
  This test verifies the key functionality of the error message displayed to the user when attempting to divide by zero. Ensuring the error message is displayed correctly helps users understand the nature of the error and further action required.

Scenario 5: Check the functionality of Okay button
Details:
  TestName: test_popupmsg_okay_button
  Description: This test verifies that clicking the 'Okay' button on the popup window destroys/closes the window.
Execution:
  Arrange: Invoke popupmsg to create popup window.
  Act: Simulate a click event on the 'Okay' button.
  Assert: Verify if the popup window is destroyed.
Validation:
  The functionality of the 'Okay' button is critical as it allows the user to acknowledge the error and close the pop-up. Further user interaction with the calculator application is contingent upon this test passing.
